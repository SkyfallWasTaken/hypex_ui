# Hypex UI

Based on the Rerun GUI theme and helpers, built around [`egui`](https://www.egui.rs/).

Defines the theme of the Rerun Viewer, and has helpers for constructing some UI elements.

Also contains our fonts (just Inter at the moment) and icons.

## Versioning Scheme

**Major and minor are both based on the `egui` version used!**
