# To-Dos

- Add a way to download icons and autogenerate `icons.rs` (maybe Feather/HeroIcons?)
- Remove unnecessary Rerun code
- Make it more flexible (e.g. command system was nice, but it was coupled to the Rerun commands!)
- Add simpler/more clear examples
- Increase contrast of design tokens - colours don't have enough contrast!
